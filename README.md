# Vue Mastery: Courses 1 - 6

I initially subscribed to Vue Mastery for my college course, in order to learn enough Vue for a semester project; however, I might go past the minimum courses to learn for my own portfolio.

# Intro to Vue

This course was framed around designing a responsive product landing page. It didn't start off using the Vue CLI like I am used to doing, but the videos were easy to follow and added an extra depth to their explanations of terms. I pushed myself to do the challenges at the end of each segment, although I only included the last challenge code because it makes the site look more complete. I am eager to start the next course because it will go through more standards that coders use in the real world.
